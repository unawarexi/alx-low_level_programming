the malloc function act as almost same as the calloc function

the calloc fun takes two args unlike the malloc 

the realloc fn also takes two args

the free * fn 


      note: they're  both automatic mem allocation and dynamic
                        the calloc, malloc, free, realloc falls under the dynamic function

             anytime you give a dynamic function always remeber to realease the mem allocated because it is not automatic after the fn returns

                             ( do this using the FREE FUNCTION )

they both have read and write permissions
  ( callooc malloc)

 memories are allocated in four segments - heap stack global/static and code/text

       the heap memory is where the funtions go and get the allocated mem from, it;s a reserved mem

the realloc is used to indrease the size or decrease the size of a  mem
     it accepts two args as well
