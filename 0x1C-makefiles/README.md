# Make and Makefiles README

## What are Make and Makefiles?
Make is a build automation tool that aids in compiling and building software projects. Makefiles are configuration files used to specify how to build and manage a project. Make uses Makefiles to understand the structure of the project and the dependencies between different files.

## When, why, and how to use Makefiles
Makefiles are used when you want to automate the build process of a software project. They are especially useful for projects with multiple source files. Makefiles describe how the source files should be compiled, linked, and organized. By using Makefiles, you can save time and ensure consistency in your build process.

To create and use Makefiles, you typically define rules for compiling source files and specify dependencies. Make can then automatically determine which parts of the project need to be rebuilt when changes are made.

## What are rules and how to set and use them
Rules in Makefiles define the relationships between target files, dependencies, and the commands needed to build or update those target files. A rule typically consists of the target, dependencies, and the commands.

Here's a basic rule structure:
```make
target: dependencies
    command
```
You specify the target file you want to create or update, the files it depends on (dependencies), and the commands needed to build or update the target.

## What are explicit and implicit rules
- `Explicit` rules are user-defined rules that specify the exact commands to be executed to build a target file. 
- `Implicit` rules, on the other hand, are predefined rules in Make that define how to build common types of files (e.g., .c to .o). You can override implicit rules with your own explicit rules.

## What are the most common/useful rules
The most common rules in Makefiles depend on your project. However, some useful rules include:

- all: To build the entire project.
- clean: To remove all generated files.
- Rules for compiling source files (e.g., .c to .o for C/C++ projects).
- Rules for linking object files into executables or libraries.

## What are variables and how to set and use them
Variables in Makefiles are used to store values that can be reused throughout the Makefile. They are useful for defining compiler flags, file paths, or any other values that need to be consistent.

To set and use variables:

```make
CC = gcc  # Set a variable for the compiler
CFLAGS = -Wall -O2  # Set compiler flags
```

## Use variables in rules
my_program: main.c helper.c
    ```$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o my_program main.c helper.c ```
Variables provide flexibility and maintainability in your Makefiles by allowing you to change values in one place rather than throughout the file
