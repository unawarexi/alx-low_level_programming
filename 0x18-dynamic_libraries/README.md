## Introduction

Dynamic libraries are essential components of software development, allowing code to be shared among multiple programs efficiently. This repository offers insights into the concepts of dynamic libraries, their creation, utilization, as well as differences between static and shared libraries. Additionally, it provides guidance on tools such as `nm`, `ldd`, and `ldconfig` for library analysis and management.

## Learning Objectives

By engaging with this repository, you will:

1. Understand the purpose and functioning of dynamic libraries and their benefits.
2. Learn how to create dynamic libraries and link them to applications.
3. Explore the significance of the `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable and learn how to use it.
4. Differentiate between static and shared libraries, along with their respective use cases.
5. Gain proficiency in utilizing `nm`, `ldd`, and `ldconfig` for library-related tasks.

## Dynamic Libraries

A dynamic library is a collection of functions and code that can be loaded into a program's memory during runtime. Unlike static libraries, dynamic libraries are not linked at compile time but are loaded when the program starts. This reduces redundancy and allows multiple programs to share the same library, leading to efficient memory usage.

### Creating and Using Dynamic Libraries

To create a dynamic library:

1. Compile the library source files: `gcc -shared -o libexample.so example.c`
2. Use the `-shared` flag to generate a shared library and link using `-o`.
3. To use the library, link it during compilation: `gcc -o my_program my_program.c -lexample`

## Environment Variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

The `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable specifies directories where the system searches for dynamic libraries before the standard paths. To use it:

1. Set the variable: `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/library:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
2. This ensures the system looks in `/path/to/library` for libraries.
3. Exercise caution as incorrect usage might lead to library conflicts.

## Static vs. Shared Libraries

Static libraries are linked at compile time and become part of the executable, making it larger. Shared libraries are loaded during runtime, leading to smaller executables and efficient memory use. Shared libraries promote modularity and enable updates without recompiling the whole program.

## Library Tools

### `nm` - Symbol Table

Use `nm` to examine symbol tables in object files and libraries:

- `nm my_program` - Display symbols in `my_program`
- `nm -D libexample.so` - Show dynamic symbols in `libexample.so`

### `ldd` - Library Dependencies

`ldd` lists shared library dependencies of an executable:

- `ldd my_program` - Display shared library dependencies for `my_program`

### `ldconfig` - Library Configuration

`ldconfig` updates the system's cache of shared library paths:

- `sudo ldconfig` - Update library cache after adding new libraries

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/unawarexi/alx-low_level_programming/0x18-dynamic_libraries.git`
2. Explore the examples and tool explanations in the relevant directories.
3. Modify and experiment with provided code examples for hands-on experience.
